          <h2>Cub Scouts Rocket Day</h2>
          <p>Cub Scouts Rocket Day is a STEM outreach event that our competitive rocket team hosts for the younger generation to help get them interested in aerospace and STEM. We go out to local schools and help kids set up and fly their own model rocket, show off and inform our hybrid rockets, and act as a positive role model.</p>

          <h2>The Big Event</h2>
          <p>If you go to TAMU, you’ve heard about the big event quite a bit. During previous years, our competitive rocket team also forms a team to participate in the big event.  We give a “thanks” back to the surrounding community by providing help and community services to those who need.</p>

          <h2>Social Impact Hackathon</h2>
          <p>This is not something I have done yet but am very interested in participating in. I would like to volunteer in a hackathon in which I can be a part of solving social issues and using my technical sills for a meaningful cause.</p>
